\title{Multi Patients Analysis of Genomic Markers}
\description{
This package provides functions to preprocess and analyze genomic data.
The package was initially developped to select genomic markers associated with a given phenotype when several samples are available.
In this context, markers refer to SNPs or copy number variations which are designed on the arrays.

The package also enables to preprocess all samples individually in order to keep maximum information from the original signals and improve the multi-patients analysis. In particular, this is useful to keep quantitative data for SNPs rather than usual genotype calls (AA, AB or BB) when these states are not relevant (eg in cancer studies where the number of copies differs from two copies).
