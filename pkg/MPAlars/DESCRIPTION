Description: This package contains an implementation of the lars algorithm [1],
    for the lasso and fusion penalization. It works even if the number of
    covariate is greater than the number of individuals. It has been designed
    for Multi Patients Analysis (MPA) of Genomics Markers. Its main purpose is
    the analysis of copy number signal but it can be used for other context.
