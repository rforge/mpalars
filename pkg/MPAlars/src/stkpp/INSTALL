                    INSTALLING STK++ UNDER UNIX
                    ===========================

This document concerns building and installing STK++ from sources.


As you are reading this file, you have unpacked the stkpp sources
and are presumably in the top directory.

You can install stk++ either using *makefile* or using *cmake*.


== BUILDING USING CMAKE ==

This project uses both the makefile and the cross-platform Make (CMake) build
system. However, we have conveniently provided a wrapper configure script and
makefile so that the typical build invocation of "./configure" followed by
"make" will work.

NOTE: Users of CMake may believe that the top-level "makefile" has been
generated by CMake; It hasn't, so please do not delete that file.

Configure options
-----------------
 
 * By default a debug version of stkpp is created. To create a release version add the option:
   ./configure -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   To go back to a debug version:
   ./configure -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

 * stkpp options:
   ./configure -DZERO_BASED_ARRAYS=ON : the first index of the arrays will start at 0
   ./configure -DREAL_ARE_FLOAT=ON : will use float rather than double as real representation

example: build a Release version with 0 based Arrays
-------

./configure -DSTKBASEARRAYS=0 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
make cdoc
make ctest

clean
-----
make cclean


== BUILDING USING MAKE ==

check the macros in the file:
----------------------------

  makevars

In particular:
 * If you don't have the Rmath library installed on your computer, set HASRMATH = f
 
 * If your make is not called "make", set the environment variable MAKE to
     its name, and use that name throughout these instructions.


Issue the following command
---------------------------

	make all
	
You will get a the static library libSTKpp.a in the lib/ directory. This library
can be linked with your own application. Take care that "make" alone will call
the cmake builder.

if you want to make the test programs, issue the following command:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

make alltests

if you want to make the manual, issue the following command:
------------------------------------------------------------

	doxygen Doxyfile

You can browse the documentation in the directory doc/html.

 
== PREREQUISITIES ==

STK++ needs a recent C++ compiler (gcc 4.3 or higher) 

If you want to compare the special functions implemented in STK++ with
the R math functions (e.g. to compile the testAnalysis program), you need
to install or compile the libRmath.a library.
